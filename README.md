# NLP-Search-Optimisation-for-Research-Papers
### Technology Used:
Text Summarization & Named Entity Recognition

### Abstract:
While working on projects, we often face problems searching for the correct resources. With an incredible amount of research papers available out there, it becomes tough to find the one matching your needs. To optimize searches of the correct resources and research paper, we would like to come up with a product that effectively summarizes text and tag the text with the most weighted entities. Here we will use extractive summarization as extractive methods attempt to summarize articles by selecting a subset of words that retain the most important points. Here we will find custom-named entities from the summarized text like related technologies, authors, conferences, etc. These entities will be tagged to optimize their research. 

### Tech-Stack: 
Python (coding language), NLTK (library), Spacy (library), Streamlit (web interface).
