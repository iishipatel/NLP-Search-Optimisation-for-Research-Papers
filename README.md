# NLP-Search-Optimisation-for-Research-Papers
### Technology Used:
Text Summarization & Named Entity Recognition

### Abstract:
We are optimizing searches of educational texts with providing a brief summary containing the gist of the whole text as well as custom named entity tagging for efficiently relating the educational text with appropriate keywords. Here we use extractive summarization over abstractive summarization because in abstractive summarization there is a chance that the new sentences generated alter the meaning of the text. In extractive summarization important sentences are filtered for summarization.The custom NER will help us identify keywords which answers questions such as “ Which subject ?”, “Which domain ?”, “Who’s the author?”, etc.

### Tech-Stack: 
Python (coding language), NLTK (library), Spacy (library), Streamlit (web interface).
